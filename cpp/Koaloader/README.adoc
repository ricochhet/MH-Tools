= üê® Koaloader üì•

A collection of DLLs that use search order hijacking to automatically inject specified DLLs.

https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2536753#p2536753[Official forum topic]

== üöÄ Usage

Simply place one of the proxy dlls where a process is attempting to load it and set up the config file to load the DLLs that you wish to inject.

=== üìö Supported proxies

NOTE: ‚ûï If you wish to see another proxy DLL supported, feel free to request it in the official forum topic, specifying the DLL name and describing its use case.

== ‚öô Configuration

:fn-search-dirs: search directoriesfootnote:fn-search-dirs[Search directories include  the directory where Koaloader DLL is located as well as the working directory of the target process.]

Koaloader comes with a configuration file `Koaloader.config.json`, which will be the same for any proxy dll.
The config file conforms to the standard JSON format.
The description of each available option is presented below:

`logging`::
Enables or disables logging into a `Koaloader.log` file.
Possible values: `true`, `false` (default).

`enabled`::
Entirely enables or disables Koaloader injection.
Can be used to quickly disable Koaloader without modifying files on disk.
Possible values: `true` (default), `false`.

`auto_load`:: Enables or disables automatic loading of well-known DLLs.
This can be used to automatically inject DLLs without `Koaloader.config.json` config file.
When enabled, Koaloader will first try to find a well-known DLL in parent directories of the {fn-search-dirs}.
If it failed to do so, it will recursively go through all files in {fn-search-dirs} directory and search for files with well-known file names.
Default: `true`.
A list of well-known filenames (Names ending in 32 and 64 are loaded only by 32-bit and 64-bit binaries respectively):
* `Unlocker.dll`, `Unlocker32.dll`, `Unlocker64.dll`
* `Lyptus.dll`, `Lyptus32.dll`, `Lyptus64.dll`
* `ScreamAPI.dll`,`ScreamAPI32.dll`,`ScreamAPI64.dll`
* `SmokeAPI.dll`,`SmokeAPI32.dll`,`SmokeAPI64.dll`
* `UplayR1Unlocker.dll`, `UplayR1Unlocker32.dll`, `UplayR1Unlocker64.dll`
* `UplayR2Unlocker.dll`, `UplayR2Unlocker32.dll`, `UplayR2Unlocker64.dll`

`targets`::
A list of strings that specify targeted executables.
This can be used to prevent unintended loading by irrelevant executables.
Koaloader will inject modules if, and only if:
* The list of targets is empty, **or**
* The list of targets includes an executable that has loaded Koaloader.

`modules`:: A list of objects that describe modules that will be loaded in the order they were defined.
Each object has the following properties:
+
[horizontal]
`path`::: A string that specifies absolute or relative path to a DLL.
The relative path is with respect to the working directory, which may be different from the executable directory.
`required`::: A boolean that marks the module as required for loading.
This can be used to specify behaviour when Koaloader fails to load a given module.
Failure to load required modules will result in a crash with message box, whereas in not required modules Koaloader will simply print the error in the log file.
Default: `true`.

You can refer to the following config as an example.

Here we have defined 2 DLLs to load:

* `target.dll` - via a path that is relative to the current working directory of the executable
* `eucalyptus.dll` - via an absolute path.

== üèóÔ∏è Building from source

=== üö¶ Requirements

:fn-lower-ver: footnote:lower-versions[Older versions may be supported as well.]

* CMake v3.24 (Make sure that cmake is available from powershell)
* Visual Studio 2022{fn-lower-ver}.
* Tested on Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22621.0){fn-lower-ver}.

=== üë®‚Äçüíª Commands

Clone the project with its submodules:

[source,powershell]
----
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/acidicoala/Koaloader.git
----

Run the build script with desired parameters:

[source,powershell]
----
./build.ps1 $Arch $Config $Proxy
----

where

[horizontal]
`$Arch`:: Program architecture.
Valid values:
* `32`
* `64`

`$Config`:: Build configuration.
Valid values:
* `Debug`
* `Release`
* `RelWithDebInfo`

`$Proxy`:: Proxy DLL to build.
Any DLL from `C:/Windows/System32` that includes only named exports is valid.

Example:

[source,powershell]
----
./build.ps1 64 Release d3d11
----

The final DLL will be located at
`build\$Arch\$Proxy\$Config`

=== Potential improvements

* [ ] DLLs with unnamed exports (by ordinal)
* [ ] DLLs that are missing from System32 directory

=== Miscellaneous notes

* Version is defined in link:CMakeLists.txt[CMakeLists.txt]
* CMake project likely needs to be reloaded after changing files in the link:res[res] directory.
* GitHub actions will build the project on every push to `master`, but will prepare a draft release only if the last commit was tagged.
* Proxy DLLs for CI releases need to be defined in link:.github/workflows/ci.yml[ci.yml]
